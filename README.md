# pandas-challenge
module 4 homework
# thanks for grading my work this module seemed to go by faster than the others. 
# I ran into some issues witht the formatting provided in the starter file as you can see it is commented out. 
# The error was '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'. tried to convert the columns into a different datatype using the astype and pd.to_numeric functions but it didn't work
# After removing the formatting and running the cells again the pd.cut function ran without errors so I left the formatting out since it wasn't included in the rubric
